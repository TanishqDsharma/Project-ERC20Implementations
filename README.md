# Project-ERC20Implementations

ERC-20 Spot the Bug is a smart contract security challenge featuring 20 intentionally buggy implementations of the ERC-20 token standard. Each contract contains a serious bug—ranging from logical flaws to subtle vulnerabilities—that could lead to catastrophic behavior or violate the standard.

These Implementation are created by team rareskills for education pruposes. 

As part of this project, I will be performing a comprehensive audit of each buggy ERC-20 implementation in this repository. For every contract:

* I will identify and document the critical bug(s).
* I will write targeted test cases to demonstrate the faulty behavior.
* I will produce a detailed audit report explaining the nature of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and how it deviates from the ERC-20 standard.

The audit reports and test cases will serve both as learning material and a reference for best practices in smart contract development and security.
